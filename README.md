# Robust Pareto Set Identification with Contaminated Bandit Feedback
This repository contains the implementation of the R-PSI algorithm from our paper ["Robust Pareto Set Identification with Contaminated Bandit Feedback"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02666) and Algorithm 1 from ["Pareto Front Identification from Stochastic Bandit Feedback"](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/auer16.html). 

# Experiments
The algorithms are compared on 3 setups. The results of each setup can be recreated by changing the variable "setting" inside "main.py".
